# `ppot-rs`

A Rust crate that supports reading `.ptau` (powers of tau) files from
[snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs/).

`.ptau` files containing the output of the 54th contribution to the [Perpetual
Powers of
Tau](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/perpetualpowersoftau)
(PPOT) ceremony, plus a random beacon, can be downloaded from the snarkjs
repository.

A future version will also support reading PPOT contribution files.
